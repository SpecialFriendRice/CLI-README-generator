## Generates README markdown files directly from command line input

A high-quality README file is a vital part of a GitHub repository, especially if you are looking for future contributions. Divided into clear sections, it should be a roadmap for user as well as collaborators, explaining clearly why and how the app was created, how to install it and crediting any sources. Having the ability to generate a clear README directly from the command line frees up time that can be better spent on improving the app itself.
